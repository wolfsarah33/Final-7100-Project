Final Project Checklist
If you want to see these notes with the images mentioned visit the link: https://resteraunt-manager.readme.io/docs/getting-started

a) Needed Environment
Step 1: Download Python 3.9 at https://www.python.org/downloads/
Step 2: Once Python is fully downloaded.
Make sure that all requirements are added in python 
Go to your Windows start menu and search Cmd
Step 3:Click Command prompt and this should open up a command screen
Step 4: It should look like the image below
 
This is the environment of where the code will be ran.
The GUI is Tkinter. 
b)Resources needed
Step 6: Got to windows start menu and search Python IDLE (Python 3.9 comes with this text editor)
Step 7: Click on IDLE (Python 3.9) it should look similar to the image be 
Step 8: Copy the below COPY and PASTE the code that is located in "Main.py" in to your IDLE text editor (including code here too)

[RMcode.txt](https://github.com/wolfsarah33/Final-7100-Project/files/6394797/RMcode.txt)


Step 9: The IDLE document should like the below image
 
*Be aware of the Ln: and Col: highlighted on the bottom right of the image. Your document should match
Step 10: Next you want to roll over the term "File" at the top left corner and move mouse down to "Save as" Click on it and a screen like below should pop up.
 
Step 11: Save file as a name you can remember. For my instance, I chose the word "main" and pressed Save
Step 12: After you save it will take you back to the Idle screen where the top name is changed and you will see "(the name you chose) .py" so in my case the top states "Main.py"
*It should look like image below
 
These are all the resources needed to Run this app.
c) Actually Running Steps of the Application
Step 13: Roll over "File" again and press "Open.." Right click on your file name and scroll down to "Properties" Copy the full location of the file. The screen below should pop up and the highlighted is what needs to be copied.
 
Step 14: Now that you have the location copied, Open Windows Command Prompt back up
Step 15: type in cd (Paste the location) then press ENTER
It should look similar to the image below
 
Step 16: Type in the file name you saved the IDLE file you named containing the code
 
Step 17: Now press ENTER
Step 18: Now you will see the first window of the application. This is the Username and Password Authentication Security Principle
Step 19: The ONLY username is: Admin (The A in admin must be capitalized, or it will NOT GIVE YOU ACCESS)
The ONLY password is: 123
Step 20: These are the ONLY credentials that allow access in to the Restaurant Management Application anything else will lead you to an incorrect password screen as below
 
A CORRECT STATUS WILL LOOK LIKE THE IMAGE BELOW
 
Step 21: Now you will press "Ok" This will open up the next Python window where the Restaurant Manager is accessed. Image shown below. This is an indication of ACCESS CONTROL
 
â€¢	This is where you can work with the app. Inputting numbers of how many of a certain menu item the customer had and then you press "Total" and it will give you the Cost of the Meal, Service Charge, Tax, Sub Total, and Total Cost.
The pricing of the menu items is shown when you press the button "Price" So you can check the work of the application.
You can always restart by pressing "Reset" and you can leave by pressing "Exit"
Below I will Complete an Example (THIS IS AN INDICATION OF INPUT AND OUTPUT VALIDATION)
Example:
A customer orders 1 order of fries, 2 orders of noodles, and 1 order of Soup. Now I will press Total
 
The total cost is $556.65
Lets Check the work. Press Price
 
1 Order of Fries: 140
2 Orders of Noodles: 90
1 Order of Soup: 140
Cost of Meal: 460
Cost of Meal + Service Charge + Tax = 556.65
Total Cost: 556.65
The Application Works!

A more simple way you can run the file is to from where you have the code in IDLE roll to the top menu and roll over "RUN" then click "RUN Module" This will start the application as well.
